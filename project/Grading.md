# Grading scheme for DAT640 H2020 project assignment

This grading scheme is constructed to set out the standards for each level of points scored in each category, but we ultimately looked at each submission as a whole and adjusted category grades accordingly. Each submission was also graded independently by two evaluators, and any significant discrepancies in each categories were resolved through discussion before grades were finalized. 

## Categories 
  - Problem understanding (5 points)
      - Guidance:
           - Demonstrating your understanding of the chosen project and associated task.
           - Clearly explaining the problem at hand, and the challenges it may entail.
           - Identifying main families of approaches developed for the task at hand (a literature review).
      - 5: The problem was very clearly stated, where appropriate in the students' own words, using high-quality references. The implementations are in line with the problem statement.
      - 4: The problem was clearly restated. No significant errors in problem understanding are reflected in the implementations. 
      - 3: The problem was restated in an adequate manner. Few errors reflected in implementations.  
      - 2: The problem was restated, with minor errors. Errors in understanding show up in implementations. 
      - 1: There was an attempt to restate the problem, but with major flaws. Errors in understanding significantly impact the implementations.
      - 0: There was no reasonable attempt to summarize or use an understanding of the problem at hand. 
  - Baseline method (10 points)
      - Guidance:
           - Selecting a sensible baseline, implementing and evaluating it experimentally.
      - 10: The baseline implementation is very well described, justified, implemented, and evaluated, and could be reproduced based on description.
      - 8: The baseline implementation is described, justified, implemented, evaluated with no major flaws.
      - 6: The baseline implementation is described, justified, implemented, and evaluated, but with major flaws in one of these aspects.
      - 4: The baseline implementation is described, justified, implemented, evaluated with two or more major flaws.
      - 2: The baseline implementation was attempted, but the attempt did not adequately describe, justify, implement, nor evaluate the baseline.
      - 0: No reasonable attempt was made at the baseline implementation.

  - Advanced method(s) (max 15 points)
      - Guidance:
          - Selecting an interesting or performant advanced method, implementing and evaluating it experimentally.
          - Motivating, designing and implementing one or multiple advanced approaches.
          - Either extending the baseline,
          - Employing a completely different approach found in the literature, or
          - Designing a method of your own.
          - Clarity of argumentation
          - Creativity
          - Demonstrating understanding of the advanced methods
          - Extensiveness of the experiments
          - Overall performance (improvements over baseline).
      - 15: The advanced implementation was very well described, justified, implemented, and evaluated, and could be reproduced based on description.
      - 12: The advanced implementation was described, justified, implemented, evaluated with no major flaws.
      - 9: The advanced implementation was described, justified, implemented, and evaluated, but with major flaws in one of these aspects.
      - 6: The advanced implementation was described, justified, implemented, evaluated with two or more major flaws in multiple aspects.
      - 3: The advanced implementation was attempted, but the attempt did not adequately describe, justify, implement, nor evaluate the advanced method.
      - 0: No reasonable attempt was made at the advanced implementation.
      - Bonus +3: The advanced method chosen shows creativity or ambition.
      - Bonus +3: The advanced implementation shows notable performance over an already reasonable baseline performance. 
      - Bonus +3: The completed advanced method experiments were extensive and thorough.


  - Report (max 15 points)
      - Guidance:
           - Clearly explaining the motivation or rationale behind the choices made.
           - Documenting key technical decisions to support future reproducibility.
           - This requires details with accessible wording and structure in a way that your results are reproducible based on the provided description.
           - Producing insight into the process through analysis and discussion of results.
           - Effectively using visual tools, such as illustrations, plots and tables to support and communicate your findings.
      - 15: The report is very well written, formatted, referenced, illustrated (with figures and tables), and structured. 
      - 12: The report is well written, formatted, referenced, illustrated (with figures and tables), and structured with no major flaws.
      - 9: The report is overall well written, formatted, referenced, illustrated (with figures and tables), and structured, but with major flaws in one of these aspects. 
      - 6: The report is mostly adequately written, formatted, referenced, illustrated (with figures and tables), and structured, but with two or more major flaws in multiple aspects. 
      - 3: The report was attempted, but the attempt was not adequatel written, formatted, referenced, illustrated (with figures and tables), nor structured. 
      - 0: No reasonable attempt was made to write a report. 
      - Bonus +3: The report conveys the process of conducting the project in a sober and elucidating manner. 

  - Code quality (5 points)
      - Guidance:
           - Clearly structured and readable code.
           - Readability includes sensible variable/method naming conventions and adding docstrings/comments where necessary.
           - Code quality refers to how easily an external person could work with the submitted code. 
      - 5: An external person could easily use the code base as-is. 
      - 4: An external person could use the code base as-is with only minor difficulties.
      - 3: An external person could use the code base with minor refactoring. 
      - 2: An external person could use the code base with significant refactoring. 
      - 1: An external person could only use the code base with a nearly complete refactoring. 
      - 0: No reasonable attempt was made at maintaining code quality.
